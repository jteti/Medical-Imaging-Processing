CAP 4401 – Digital Image Processing – Spring 2016*
MATLAB Assignment 1 – Due: January 30, 2016*

Included in this file are the following:

Five Script files for each question:
Script1_HW1.m
Script2_HW1.m
Script3_HW1.m
Script4_HW1.m
Script5_HW1.m

One MATLAB File created in the first script from question 1:
imagesFileInfo.mat

One PDF Report created in MATLAB, documenting all of the assignment's code  steps, and results:
Report_HW1_jteti2013.pdf

Although images were not to be included, due to the specification that medical images be used, the following CT image files have been included:
ct_3030.pgm
ct_3071.pgm
ct_4006.pgm
ct_4087.pgm

These portable graymap format (PGM) grayscale images were retrieved from http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~rstaros/mednat/index.html. 
This is a dataset of medical grayscale images used for evaluating image compression algorithms. The set was prepared as a part of the research project Nr 4 T11C 032 24, which was fully supported by the Grant of the Polish National Research Committee (KBN).
