Script5_HW2.m
Script7_HW2.m
Script8_HW2.m
Script9_HW2.m

One PDF Report created in MATLAB, documenting all of the assignment's code, steps, and results:
Report_HW2_jteti2013.pdf

To meet the specification that medical images be used for this DIS, the following Ultrasoud (US) and Computed Radiography (CR)image files have been included:
us_3403.pgm
us_19773.pgm
us_27743.pgm
cr_pacem_2.pgm

These portable graymap format (PGM) grayscale images were retrieved from http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~rstaros/mednat/index.html. 
This is a dataset of medical grayscale images used for evaluating image compression algorithms. 
The set was prepared as a part of the research project Nr 4 T11C 032 24, which was fully supported by the Grant of the Polish National Research Committee (KBN).

There are a total of 16 files included in the compressed folder.
